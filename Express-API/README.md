├── models/         🗃️  Database table shapes (Mongoose schemas)
├── middlewares/    🚦  Code that runs BEFORE your handler (auth, validation, rate-limit)
├── routes/         🗺️  URL → handler mapping (what URL calls what function)
├── controllers/    📬  Receives the HTTP request, sends the HTTP response
├── services/       🧠  The actual business logic (talks to the DB)

## Express API Flow
Request → Route → (Middleware) → Controller → Service → Database
                                                         ↓
Response ←────────────────────────────────── Controller ←─


## Backend Data Flow    
1. Request arrives at Express
        ↓
2. app.js runs Helmet (security headers)
        ↓
3. app.js runs CORS check (is this origin allowed?)
        ↓
4. app.js runs Rate Limiter (has this IP sent too many requests?)
        ↓
5. Route matched: POST /api/v1/products → product.route.js
        ↓
6. validate(createProductSchema) middleware runs:
   ✅ "name" is a string ✓
   ✅ "price" is a number ✓
   → req.body is now safe, typed data
        ↓
7. productController.createProduct() runs
        ↓
8. ProductService.createProduct(req.body) is called
        ↓
9. MongoDB saves the document
        ↓
10. Controller sends: 201 { success: true, data: { ... }, message: "Product created" }
