// create a package.json file:
// npm init -y

check Node.js Documations:

// fs ==> create file, crate folder, read file, read folder, delete file, delete folder, copy file, rename file, rename folder

# http and https modules
1. protocols ==> rules ==> how to send data, how to receive data, how to handle errors, how to manage connections, etc.
2. http ==> Hypertext Transfer Protocol
3. https ==> Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure

// http and https modules are used to create web servers, make HTTP requests, and handle HTTP responses in Node.js. They provide a way to communicate over the web using the HTTP protocol. The http module is used for non-secure communication, while the https module is used for secure communication using SSL/TLS encryption.

// const http = require('http');
// const server = http.createServer(function(req, res){
res.end("Hello world")
})

// server.listen(3000)

## npm understanding

// npm is a package manager for JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. npm allows developers to easily share and reuse code, manage dependencies, and automate tasks in their projects. With npm, developers can install and manage third-party libraries and tools, making it easier to build and maintain applications.

## module and package

// module is defualt install with node.js and it is a single file or a collection of files that can be imported and used in other parts of the application. A package, on the other hand, is a collection of modules that are bundled together and can be published and shared with others through npm. A package typically includes a package.json file that contains metadata about the package, such as its name, version, dependencies, and scripts.

// For example, the http module is a built-in module in Node.js that provides functionality for creating web servers and making HTTP requests. It can be imported and used in any Node.js application without needing to install it separately. On the other hand, a package like Express is a popular web framework for Node.js that provides additional features and functionality for building web applications. It is not included in Node.js by default and needs to be installed separately using npm before it can be used in an application.

// packages is you installed using npm and modules is you can use without installing anything.

## installing and uninstalling packeages:

// npm install packagename / npm i package name
// npm uninstall package name / npm un package name

## understanding node_modules

## dependencies

// dependencies are the packages that your project needs to run. They are listed in the package.json file under the "dependencies" section. When you install a package using npm, it is added to the dependencies list in the package.json file. These packages are required for your application to function properly and will be installed when someone else installs your project using npm install.
// npm i packagenmae

## devDependencies

// devDependencies are the packages that are only needed during the development phase of your project. They are listed in the package.json file under the "devDependencies" section. These packages are not required for your application to run in production, but they are useful for tasks such as testing, linting, and building your project. When someone else installs your project using npm install, the devDependencies will not be installed unless they specifically include the --dev flag.
// only install for development purposes, not needed in production environment.
// npm i package name --save-dev / npm i packagename --dev

## scripts - understaning default scripts and creating custom scriptsch

// start vs test vs build vs pre and post scripts
// npm run start vs npm start ==> npm start is a shortcut for npm run start. When you run npm start, it will look for a script named "start" in the package.json file and execute it. If you have defined a "start" script, it will run that command. If you haven't defined a "start" script, it will default to running node server.js. On the other hand, npm run start allows you to run any script defined in the package.json file by specifying the script name after "run". For example, if you have a script named "build", you can run it using npm run build.

// scripts are commands that can be run using npm. They are defined in the package.json file
// under the "scripts" section. There are some default scripts that are commonly used in Node.js projects, such as "start", "test", and "build". The "start" script is typically used to start the application, while the "test" script is used to run tests, and the "build" script is used to build the application for production.

// write into package.json file:
// start: "node server.js"
// pre and post scripts are special scripts that can be defined in the package.json file. A pre script is a script that runs before a specified script, while a post script runs after a specified script. For example, if you have a "build" script, you can define a "prebuild" script that runs before the build process starts, and a "postbuild" script that runs after the build process is complete. This allows you to perform additional tasks or setup before or after the main script is executed.

// npm i chalk
// npm i concurrency


## Express.js
// Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a simple and flexible way to build web applications and APIs. Express.js allows developers to handle routing, middleware, and HTTP requests and responses with ease. It is widely used for building server-side applications and is known for its minimalistic approach, making it easy to learn and use for both beginners and experienced developers. With Express.js, you can quickly create robust and scalable web applications using Node.js.

// create a basic express.js server:
// npm i express
// copy and paste form npm i express documentation:
// create a routes
// npm i nodemon -g
// npx nodemon server.js // nodemon server.js


// Middleware
// app.use(express.json()) // for parsing application/json
// app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })) // for parsing application/x-www-form-urlencoded
// app.use(function(req, res, next) {
// console.log('Time:', Date.now())
// next()
// })
// app.get('/', (req, res) => {
// res.send('Hello World!')
// })

// error handling (this is last listed route, because it will catch all the errors that are not handled by the previous routes)
// app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
// console.error(err.stack)
// res.status(500).send('Something broke!')
// })

// Setting up an Express.js server:





// session or cookies
// session is a way to store data on the server side, while cookies are a way to
store data on the client side. Sessions are typically used to store user-specific information, such as login status or shopping cart contents, while cookies are used to store small pieces of data that can be accessed by the client, such as user preferences or tracking information. Sessions are more secure than cookies because they are stored on the server and cannot be easily tampered with by the client. However, cookies can be useful for storing non-sensitive information that needs to be accessed by the client, such as language preferences or theme settings.

// cookie parse = npm i cookie-parser
// cookie-parser is a middleware for Express.js that allows you to parse cookies in incoming HTTP requests. It provides a convenient way to access and manipulate cookies in your Express.js applications. With cookie-parser, you can easily read and write cookies, set cookie options such as expiration and path, and handle cookie-related functionality in your routes and middleware. It simplifies the process of working with cookies in Express.js and helps you manage user sessions and preferences effectively.
